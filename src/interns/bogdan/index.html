                        My name is Bogdan and I am a computer science student. I immigrated from Russia to the United
                        States when I was 13 years old. I took my first programming lesions when I was 12, still back in
                        Russia...so I was into coding for...a very long time. I enjoy computer programming because it is
                        fun. After all, you get to solve puzzles - who doesn’t like puzzles? Another reason I enjoy
                        programming is because of how limitless the capabilities are of what one can build! With enough
                        computation power and time it’s possible to solve many of humanity’s problems using the “finite
                        state machines” which computers are. I think it’s really cool that’s all.</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        During an internship I would like to learn by working with professional engineers, because
                        learning by
                        doing is what works for me. I want to experience the sleepless nights trying to figure out how a
                        company’s stack works and get good at it and writing code that I can feel proud of. I want to
                        work in a team of fellow engineers, get to
                        attend real Scrum meetings and possibly make some friends and connections.</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        I personally like web development, back-end in particular. I want to become a great full-stack
                        software engineer one day so I can make any web software I want. I have had many side projects
                        abandoned due to lack of time needed to learn some back-end knowledge. If I get to work at your
                        company I will be very happy and will contribute with all my enthusiasm for software
                        development.</p>
